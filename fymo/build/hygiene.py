"""Directory-hygiene validation, shared by `fymo build` and `fymo dev`.

app/controllers/ is Python-only; app/templates/ and app/components/ are
frontend-only (.svelte/.ts). A misplaced file doesn't actually break
anything mechanically -- Python's controller loader never tries to import
a stray .svelte file, and esbuild never bundles a stray .py file sitting
in a template/component directory -- which is exactly what makes it easy
to miss without an explicit check: the file just silently does nothing,
instead of erroring where a developer would notice.
