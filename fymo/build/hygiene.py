    internal storage helper landed in app/remote/ with no auth guard and
    turned out to be reachable over the wire).

    A no-op (returns []) whenever `fymo.remote.mode.resolve_remote_mode`
    resolves `hygiene_enforced=False` for the given config: that covers

    nothing silently exposed to warn about), `remote.mode: implicit-legacy`,
    and the deprecated `explicit_optin`/`allow_implicit` spellings of both.

    Lets `RemoteModeConfigError` propagate uncaught (an invalid `mode:`
    value, or `mode:` combined with a deprecated key) so the caller
