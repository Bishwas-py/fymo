We are on the way to develop an monolith web framework
 for quick development. This web framework will allow developers to develop efficient webapps fast.

> FyMo:
> **Fy** stands for full stack for Python, **Mo** stands for monolith  

## Work done so far
- [x] Controllers: to send context, do backend and functional stuff
- [x] Routes: `routes.yml` is currently used to make/address routes
- [x] Templates: Python context are being rendered
via string formatting

## Yet to be done
- [ ] ORM: Model and ORM is yet to be done
- [ ] Svelte Template Rendering, [livebud/bud](https://github.com/livebud/bud/discussions/248) as inspiration 
- [ ] SPA routing


 These are some stuff for now, will be updating regularly.
