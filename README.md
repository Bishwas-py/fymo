# FyMo
A full stack monolith python web framework; renders svelte in client/server side

We are on the way to develop an monolith web framework
 for quick development. This web framework will allow developers to 
develop efficient webapps fast.

## Work done so far
- [x] Controllers: to send context, do backend and functional stuff
- [x] Routes: `routes.yml` is currently used to make/address routes
- [x] Templates: Python context are being rendered
via string formatting

## Yet to be done
- [ ] ORM: Model and ORM is yet to be done
- [ ] Svelte Template Rendering
- [ ] SPA routing


 These are some stuff for now, will be updating regularly.
